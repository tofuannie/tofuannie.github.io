	<h3> <b> Hello! </b>
	<p>
			
		<p> <b>
		My name is Annie Cao.</b>
		I'm in my third year of studies in <b> Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo. </b> 
		<p> I'd like to earn my CPA designation after completing my Master's in Accounting. <p>
		<div class="highlight">
		But my current obessession is UX design. I dove into the world of hackathons by attending <a href="https://cuhacking.com/"> CUHack</a> February 16-17th, 2019 and by volunteering at <a href="https://hackthenorth.com"> Hack the North </a> 2019. </div>
		<p> I'm currently working on learning all things design (listening to the audiobook of 'The Design of Everyday Things - by Don Norman) and building my portfolio. My goal is to enter this field either during an internship or after my graduation. 
		<p>
		<p> In 2019, I had my first internship in Audit for KPMG, and I will be returning in Tax for my upcoming internship. I really look forward to learning new skills and challenging myself in things I'm passionate about!  
	
		<p> Some things about me: 
		<ul>
			<li>I love giving back to the community and traveling - I volunteered as an English in Taiwan last summer. <a href="https://anniecao21.wixsite.com/website"> Here is a link to my blog. </a></li>
			<li>I'm passionate about all things visual arts, including drawing, painting, fashion, and design. </li>
			<li>Photography makes me very happy! I'm was a photographer for <a href="http://www.fashionforchange.ca/"> Fashion for Change</a>, gaining all sorts of cool experience and meeting awesomely creative people!
			<li>I feel strongly about reducing our waste, protecting our environment, and doing more to help save the planet. Hopefully, technology, cultural awareness, and sustainability will keep this movement going.
			<li>I run a food blog on Instagram @annieseats. It all started as a hobby and now I'm helping many food establishments reach out to consumers with one goal in mind: <p>
		<b> Good food should be shared. </b> </li>
		</h3> <p>

	<h3> <b> Ok, next. <p> Why did I create this website when I'm studying Accounting and Financial Management?</b>
	<p><p>
	Luckily, I happen to be surrounded by some of the most driven, and hardworking people my age who are working so hard to achieve their goals. I've seen the fruits of their labour with my own eyes these past few years. 
	I was inspired by my peers and my drive to impress myself with what I can do. Having a passion to learn something that brings you joy is truly special, and I am so grateful for the opportunity I've been given so that I can learn to create such things. <p>
	Since I was nine years old, I've been creating art. Now that I'm surrounded by new resources and newfound interests in the digital world, it would be foolish not to take this chance.
	<p><p> With love, <br>
	Annie. </h3>

			<h3><b>Who have I collaborated with?</b></h3> 
			<h3>Throughout the year, I've been contacted by new food establishments to help them promote their grand opening. I haven't been able to attend each invitation, so notable mentions go out to Yifang Tea, OneZo Tapioca, and Captain's Broil!</h3>
