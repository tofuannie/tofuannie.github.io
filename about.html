	<h3> <b> Hello! </b>
	<p>
			
		<p> <b>
		My name is Annie Cao.</b>
		I'm in my second year of studies in <b> Accounting and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo. </b> 
		<p> I'd like to earn my CPA designation after completing my Master's in Accounting. <p>
		<div class="highlight">
		But my current obessession is web design, and I'm looking into getting involved with hackathons (update: I'm going to <a href="https://cuhacking.com/"> CUHack</a> February 16-17th, 2019 and got into <a href="https://2019.uottahack.ca/"> UOttahack </a> February 9th, 2019!) </div>
		<p>
		<p> From January 2019 until April 2019, I'm currenly doing my first co-op as a Staff accountant for KPMG LLP. I really look forward to learning new skills and challenging myself in things I'm passionate about!  
	
		<p> Some things about me: 
		<ul>
			<li>I love giving back to the community - I volunteered as an English in Taiwan this summer. <a href="https://anniecao21.wixsite.com/website"> Here is a link to my blog. </a></li>
			<li>I'm passionate about visual arts, including drawing and painting. <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio.</a></li>
			<li>Photography makes me very happy! I'm currently a photographer for <a href="http://www.fashionforchange.ca/"> Fashion for Change</a>, gaining all sorts of cool experience and meeting awesomely creative people!
			<li>I LOVE to travel :D</li>
			<li>I'm interested in learning about sustainable living, the future, technology and cultures.
			<li>Another hobby of mine is running my food blog on Instagram. It all started as a hobby and now I'm helping many food establishments reach out to consumers with one goal in mind: <p>
		<b> Good food should be shared. </b> </li>
		</h3> <p>

	<h3> <b> Ok, next. <p> Why did I create this website when I'm in Accounting?</b>
	<p><p>
	In this day and age, knowing how to use technology and having the basic skills used in creating a website (such as basic HTML and CSS) should be common knowledge. 
	<p><p> <i>If you have an interest in learning and are willing to put time and effort into it, why not? </i>
	<p>
	<p>
	I was inspired by my peers and my drive to impress myself with what I can do. Having a passion to learn something that brings you joy is truly special, and I am so grateful for the opportunity that I can learn to create such things. <p>
	Since I was nine years old, I've been creating art. Now that I'm surrounded by resources and newfound interests in the digital world, it would be foolish not to take this chance.
	<p> With love, <br>
	Annie. </h3>
