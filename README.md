Hello!
This is my first project: my personal website, as of December 2nd, 2018.  I'd like to use this to keep track and thank the friends who've helped me through this journey (can't say achieve this goal yet, because I'm not finished) and without them, I would not have been able to initiate, and continue this project!

First of all, I need to thank Jason for inspiring me in the first place by wow-ing me with his own website and making me think "I wish I was this good". Not only that, but for encouraging me and telling me that I am able to do it too if I wanted to, no matter my previous experience or what I'm currently studying at school. Finally, without sending me the initial tutorial video you sent me, I would have been a lost fish on land, because that was the start of it all.

Next, I'd like to thank Evan for introducing Github pages to me when I was looking for free webhosts that were not scams through my (many) random Google searches trying to build the website. Even though I've never used it before, I know how common it is to use the Github platform among developers and I'm glad I've been able to familiarize myself with it.

I'd also like to thank Yaheng for helping me work out why my files weren't appearing when I was in a time of deep frustration, and to help a gal out, I wouldn't have a site right now without you.

Also, thank you to CS100 for introducing me to HTML and CSS and making sure I had the right text editor installed ahead of time!
